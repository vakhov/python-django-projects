    ``handle_received_message`` method is designed to perform operations
    with the received message such that ``retrieve_messages`` is able to
    retrieve it afterwards.

    These methods are responsible for long polling implementation:
    ``retrieve_messages`` waits for new_message_event at its start,
    ``handle_received_message`` signals new_message_event at its end.

    The handlers can be customized and replaced extending this class
